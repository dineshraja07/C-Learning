The trace of the programming language C++ can be done back to 1979
when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing some development for this thesis for PhD.
One in all the words Stroustrup had the chance to figure with,
was a language referred to as Simula, that because the name implies, 
could be a language primarily designed for simulations. 
The Simula sixty-seven language â€“ that was the variant that Stroustrup
worked with is considered the primary language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm.
Stroustrup found that this paradigm was helpful for package development;
but, the Simula language was way too slow for practice & practical use.
